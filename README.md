# ps2split
A ps2 ELF splitting tool to assist with decompilation and modding projects.  
It was created mainly for 'Frogger: The Great Quest', and 'Silent Hill 2'.

This is based on an n64 rom splitter, https://github.com/ethteck/n64splat  

For example usage, see https://github.com/ethteck/papermario  
The Makefile `setup` target calls n64splat with a config file that you can use for reference. More documentation coming soon.
